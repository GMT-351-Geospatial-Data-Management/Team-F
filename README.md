# Overview
### Backend
- PostgreSQL must be installed and running. Windows 11 64bit PostgreSQL 15 was used for this project.
- Postman is an API (Application Programming Interface) development platform for testing and modifying APIs.
### Frontend
- React deals with a user input field and displaying the value in a table. The user can edit and delete inputs.
- Javascript XLM (JSX) and HTML: At the heart of a website are HTML documents. Your web browser reads these documents and displays them as web pages on the screen of your computer or other electronic devices you use. During this process, browsers create a structure called Document Oriented Model (DOM) about how pages are arranged. Updating the DOM using JSX brings an incredible website performance boost and development efficiency. (see JavaScript XML (JSX) , React Fragments )
